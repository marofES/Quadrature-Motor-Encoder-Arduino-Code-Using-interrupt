# Quadrature-Motor-Encoder-Arduino-Code-Using-interrupt
What is a quadrature encoder used for?  A quadrature encoder is an incremental encoder with 2 out-of-phase output channels used in many general automation applications where sensing the direction of movement is required. Here Used 2 Interrupt INT0 (pin 2) and INT1 (pin 3)  INT0 for contineously Driving motor INT1 for direction motor and slot counting  For digital sensor input from pin 5 -- encoder motor pin connected  For Display uses 16*2 Lcd and pin configure (13,12,11,10,9,8)
